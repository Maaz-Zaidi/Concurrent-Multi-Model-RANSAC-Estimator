#Concurrent Multi Model RANSAC Estimator (Go)

3D object visualization system using Java and Go, incorporating KD-tree for efficient clustering and nearest-neighbor searches within a RANSAC-based algorithm. The system outputs 3D visualizations in Python using Open3D and Pandas.

Implemented a RANSAC algorithm in Go to identify planar structures, enhancing multi-model estimation and large outlier handling with KD-tree optimization.
Improved previous Java model performance by integrating concurrency pipelines, channels, goroutines, and anonymous functions in Go, significantly accelerating model parameter estimation.
Visualization of clusters can be found in the previous repo: https://github.com/Maaz-Zaidi/Multi-Model-RANSAC-Estimator
